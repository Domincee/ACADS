# 🟡 Week 1: Data Preprocessing

- Here, I’ll be documenting what I’ve learned and what I will be learning about data preprocessing.  


# ✔️ What I already know:

- Data preprocessing is the first step before building a model
- Data preprocessing checks and ensure that there is no null values inside the data
- Correct inconsistencies like ("Male" and "male")


#  What Are My Expectations

- Learn how to properly perform data preprocessing  
- Practice syntax for handling null values and related tasks  
- Explore different ways of writing code for preprocessing  
- Get familiar with libraries commonly used for data preprocessing  


# What I'll be learning and what I've learned 
- I will add my learnings below the corresponding materials.
