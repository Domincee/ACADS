#  Python Tutorial Notebook

Welcome!   
This notebook is designed to introduce **Python fundamentals** step by step, using practical examples and exercises you can try directly in Kaggle.  

---

I already have some experience with **Java programming**, which gives me a solid foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. This will make it easier to understand Python concepts, but Iâ€™ll also need to adapt to Pythonâ€™s unique features, such as:  

- Dynamic typing (no need to declare variable types)  
- Indentation instead of curly braces for code blocks  
- Simpler, more readable syntax

## 1. Introduction to Python
- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.  
- It emphasizes readability and simplicity.  

ðŸ‘‰ Print your first line of Python code:  
```python
print("Hello, First Code in Python haha")

```

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Goals
By the end of this notebook, I should be able to:
- Write basic Python code using variables, operators, and functions  
- Work with conditionals, loops, and strings  
- Understand the differences between Python and Java syntax  
- Prepare myself for using Python in **data analysis and machine learning**
